## Recipo

I've often felt recipe applications were never quite right for what I was looking for, so I decided to build my own.  I'm into fermenting things (kombucha, hot sauce, vegetables) and so I'm constantly making small tweaks to the same recipe.  So what I'm going for with Recipo is to make something that is good at tracking variations over time.
